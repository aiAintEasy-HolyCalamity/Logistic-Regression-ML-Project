# Logistic-Regression-ML-Project
Implementation of logistic regression using Python and NumPy to classify binary outcomes. This project demonstrates key concepts like the sigmoid function, cost computation, gradient descent, and decision boundaries in a simple and interpretable setup.

# Logistic Regression Project

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook `C1_W3_Logistic_Regression.ipynb`, which demonstrates the implementation and analysis of Logistic Regression. This project is meant for educational purposes, focusing on data preparation, model training, evaluation, and interpretation of logistic regression results.

## Overview

This project provides a step-by-step walkthrough of logistic regression using a dataset (or a simulated dataset). The notebook includes the following:

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Methods to clean and prepare data for logistic regression.
- **Model Implementation:** Techniques to build, train, and validate a logistic regression model.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Use of metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix to evaluate the model.
- **Interpretation:** A discussion on the meaning of logistic regression coefficients and their significance.

## Contents

- `C1_W3_Logistic_Regression.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing the logistic regression analysis.
- Additional dataset files (if applicable).

## Installation

To run the notebook, you will need Python installed on your machine as well as the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- jupyter notebook

If you do not have these libraries installed, you can install them using pip:
